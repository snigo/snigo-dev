# Welcome to @snigo's home

This my personal website where I'll publish all my side projects, blog articles, my open-source tools and general information about me! Creation of this website was inspired by [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) movement and I'm planning to release v1.0.0 on Day 100. Romantic, isn't it?
